# Workout Warmup Calculator

Stop guessing your warmups. Start lifting smarter. This simple tool generates a science-backed warmup routine to prepare you for heavy lifts, helping you increase performance and reduce injury risk.

## ðŸ¤” Why This App Exists

As the weights on the bar get heavier, your warmups should get smarter. I was tired of winging my warmups and couldn't find a simple, science-backed tool to plan them. So, I built one.

This project started as an experiment with **Perplexity Labs** to generate the initial code and structure. From there, **GitHub Copilot** helped me refine, debug, and build out the features. It's a testament to how AI-powered tools can turn a simple idea into a handy app.

## âœ¨ Features

* ðŸ”¬ **Science-Backed Warmup Calculator:** Input your main lift, target weight, and reps to get a precise warm-up plan with calculated sets and weights.
* ðŸ“± **Mobile-First \& PWA-Ready:** Works flawlessly on your phone at the gym or on your desktop at home.
* ðŸ“‹ **Copy to Clipboard:** Instantly copy your warmup plan to paste into your workout log or notes.
* ðŸ“– **References Included:** Curious about the science? All research papers and articles are shown in the app's accordion section.

## ðŸš€ Roadmap

* [ ] Manually check and revise the calculation formula.
* [ ] Refine the references section for better readability.
* [ ] Convert the site into a full Progressive Web App (PWA).
* [ ] Apply a Cloudflare domain, SSL, and analytics.
